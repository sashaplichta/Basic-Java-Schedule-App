# Job Manager
## Motivation
This project interests me because I am currently working a job between
classes, and one issue that I have found tedious to deal with ist that
of tracking hours. An application that allows me to easily tap in and
out of work would save me a great deal of acounting at the end of the
week. A relatively simple functionality addition is that of a tracker
by day of worked hours vs scheduled, as well as the surplus or deficit
accrued. Users could be anyone who has a schedule and wishes to track
whether they are keeping to this schedule.

In short, this application will be a "job manager" that allows a user to easily 
compare hours worked to scheduled hours for multiple jobs. It will be
geared towards university students and others who would want to budget 
time between different jobs/tasks.

## A Quick Note
The ScheduleApp class runs a console-based version of the app, while the 
ScheduleUI runs a GUI version of the app.

## Functionality
### A way to track job hours (*projected* and *actual*)

For example, a job landing page may contain:
- **Job 1** (5hr)
- **Job 2** (15hr)
- **Job 3** (35hr)

With each job linking to a corresponding page such as:

**Job X**
- Hours on *Monday*
- Hours on *Tuesday*
- ...

And for each job you should be able to "tap" in to and out of work
## User Stories
